# console_hiscore

This project aims to bring hiscore saving support for emulators of old videogames consoles (like the [https://highscore.mameworld.info MAME hiscore plugin]).

Currently provides:
 - MAME `console_hiscore` plugin forked from the [https://github.com/mamedev/mame/tree/master/plugins/hiscore official one] with support for long filenames ROMs;
 - `console_hiscore.dat` file with some code entries (contributions are welcomed)
 - a crappy python script to extract hiscore data from emulatore savestates (currently supports only: Nestopia, GENPLUS-GX)
 
Check the wiki for more details.
